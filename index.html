	<p>During an aerodynamic design evaluation effort, several different types of data are often collected. The task for the aerodynamicist is to formulate an explanation of the observed behavior that takes into consideration the features shown in this multimodal data, so that design decisions can be made. The fusion of data features into a coherent explanation of the observed behaviour is usually done solely in the mind of the expert. This paper presents a web-based approach that reduces the burden placed on the expert by: (1) allowing image based data, for example oil or flow-visualisation paint images to be visually fused with relevant CFD and experimental data, such as area traverse measurements, in a common 3D coordinate system, and (2) supporting collaborative data analysis and capture of experts' observations by adding 3D annotation shapes, capturing particular views, and text comments. The web-based implementation enables collaborative work, and is portable between commercial electronic devices, such as smartphones and tablets. Such devices not only allow the engineer to move to a new location for the analysis, but also enable the aerodynamicist to easily capture additional image-based data using the devices' cameras.</p>


<!--p>Alternately, the project can be seen as a 3D scientific data visualisation analogue of videos shared online. In the ASME GT 2022 "Industrializing Terabytes for Propulsion and Power" plenary session a desire for shareable open datasets, and ability to capture and transfer insights between engineers effectively was expressed. Focus was put on the scientific community to provide these solutions, and, as many attendees lamented afterwards, not many specific ideas were put forward. This project can be seen to address the challenges posed by the plenary members by providing (1) a web-based environment to share ready made interactive 3D design, simulation, and experimental measurement data visualisations, and (2) the tools to capture insights and annotations collaboratively within the 3D environment.</p-->

FOR SOME THINGS THE DATA WILL HAVE TO BE LOADED INTO THE BROWSER ANYWAY, LIKE INTERACTIVE EXTRACTION OF LIFT DISTRIBUTIONS, AND BOUNDARY LAYER VELOCITY PROFILES.

BOUNDARY LAYER: Could be interesting to see the boundary layer thinckness calculated for the entire wing. And maybe seed the streamlines such that the boundary layer flows are visible?

Some components have analogous solutions already implemented within ParaView, but the drawback of ParaView is that it is not web-based, and some of its features, such as streamline sampling, could be improved. This project proposes to view ParaView as a staging environment before it is pu

ParaView isn't online, and features have some issues. ParaView is staging environment before publishing.
